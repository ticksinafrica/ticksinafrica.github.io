## Background

Ticks are the most important vectors of disease-causing pathogens in domestic and wild animals and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a major threat to both cattle and human health. Understanding the complex interactions within the microbiome is of great importance for understanding how tick-borne pathogens spread and cause disease. Our results will give us insights into the microbiome of cattle and its relation to tick microbiome. Possibly, new diseases causing agents will be identified.

These results can be used to develop diagnostic tests. Through fast and accurate diagnostics, proper treatment can be quickly started, thus reducing spread of infection. Improved health in cattle can also increase production. The study will also contribute with knowledge on how cattle owners understand the relationships between ticks, cattle and TBDs. The knowledge generated in this project can contribute to more appropriately designed interventions for diagnosis and prevention of TBDs.

## Aims of the project

- To morphologically and genetically describe the tick species population feeding on cattle in Uganda.
- To determine the seroprevalence of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in  Ugandan cattle.
- To describe the cattle ownersâ€™ perception of ticks and TBDs, disease management and general farm challenges.
- To investigate the presence of known and, possibly, unknown viruses, bacteria and parasites in ticks.
- To investigate the presence of known, and possibly, unknown viruses, bacteria and parasites in blood from cattle.
